Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 2 hours / session

Course Description
------------------

This class presents a detailed study of soil properties with emphasis on interpretation of field and laboratory test data and their use in soft-ground construction engineering. Topics to be covered include: consolidation and secondary compression; basic strength principles; stress-strain strength behavior of clays, emphasizing effects of sample disturbance, anisotropy, and strain rate; strength and compression of granular soils; and engineering properties of compacted soils. Some knowledge of field and laboratory testing is assumed for all students. 1.37 is desirable, and 1.361 is a prerequisite.

| --- | --- |
|  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _Advantages  {{< br >}}_  {{< br >}}Well defined boundary conditions → well defined soil properties via interpretation with continuum mechanics.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Can control loading and drainage conditions → property variation with stress path and drainage.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Known soil type and features. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  | _Advantages_  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Testing soil at in situ conditions and usually less affected by disturbance.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Usually lower cost, more rapid and some field tests (CPTU) can provide continuous profile.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Best suited for spatial variability → mean trends + scatter about mean. |
